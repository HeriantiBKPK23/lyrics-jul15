[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr]
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
